This repository showcases an advanced weather forecast application, demonstrating proficiency in modern JavaScript, API integration, and dynamic content rendering.

## Project: Weather Forecast Application

An interactive web application that provides detailed weather forecasts based on user-input zip codes.

### Key Features:
- Fetch location data based on zip code input
- Retrieve and display 4-day weather forecasts
- Show detailed weather information for selected days
- Responsive and styled user interface

### Technologies and Concepts:
- HTML5, CSS3 (with Bootstrap and SASS)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack and Babel for modern JavaScript development
- OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Asynchronous JavaScript with Fetch API and Promises

### Implementation Highlights:
1. **Application Structure:**
   - ES6 Class-based architecture
   - State management for application data
   - Event-driven programming

2. **API Integration:**
   - Dual API calls: geolocation and weather data
   - Error handling for API requests

3. **Dynamic Content Rendering:**
   - Template literals for HTML generation
   - DOM manipulation for updating UI

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Form submission handling
   - Click events for detailed weather view

5. **Data Processing:**
   - Custom date formatting and manipulation
   - Weather data parsing and formatting

### Key Methods:
- `constructor()`: Initializes state and UI elements
- `onFormSubmit()`: Handles form submission and API calls
- `renderWeatherListItem()`: Generates HTML for individual forecast days
- `renderWeatherList()`: Displays the complete forecast list
- `renderCurrentDay()`: Shows detailed weather for a selected day
- `clearCurrentDay()`: Resets detailed weather display


## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced JavaScript (ES6+) programming
- Asynchronous programming and Promise handling
- API integration and data manipulation
- Responsive web design
- Modern development workflow (Webpack, Babel)
- Error handling and user feedback
