## Project: Weather Forecast Application

An interactive web application that provides weather forecasts for user-specified locations.

### Key Features:
- Fetch weather data based on zip code input
- Display 4-day weather forecast
- Show detailed weather information for selected days
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Bootstrap and SASS)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack for module bundling
- Babel for JavaScript transpiling
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- Fetch API for AJAX requests

### Learning Highlights:
- API integration (OpenWeatherMap)
- Asynchronous JavaScript with Promises and Fetch API
- ES6 Modules for code organization
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Date handling in JavaScript
- Error handling in asynchronous operations

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following skills and concepts:

1. **Advanced JavaScript**
   - ES6+ features (classes, arrow functions, template literals, modules)
   - Asynchronous programming with Promises and Fetch API
   - Date manipulation and formatting

2. **API Integration**
   - Making multiple API calls (geolocation and weather data)
   - Parsing and utilizing JSON responses

3. **Modern Web Development Tools**
   - Webpack for module bundling and asset management
   - Babel for cross-browser compatibility
   - SASS for advanced styling

4. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Dynamic content updates based on API responses and user interactions
   - Event handling for form submissions and user selections

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Flexbox for layout
   - Bootstrap for responsive components

6. **Code Organization**
   - ES6 Modules for separating concerns
   - Class-based architecture for main application logic

## Future Directions
- Implement geolocation API for automatic location detection
- Add more detailed weather information (e.g., precipitation chance, UV index)
- Implement a map view for visualizing weather patterns
- Add support for different units (metric/imperial)
